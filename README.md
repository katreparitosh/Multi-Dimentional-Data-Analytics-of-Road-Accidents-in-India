A statistical data analysis project on Road Accidents of India over a period of 5-7 years using various [Python Libraries](#lib).
The project is performed using `Jupyter Notebook` and `Tableau`.

## Python Libraries Used : <a id = 'lib'></a>
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Analysis :

- Jupyter Notebook
1) Analysing accidents **PER LAKH** population of the state.
2) Analysis of accidents according to the **GENDER of OFFENDER and the VICTIM.**
3) Understanding the occurence of accidents because of improper, ignorant use of **VEHICLE SAFETY ACCESSORIES** like helmets, seat belts.
4) Analysing road accidents based upon the **NUMBER OF LANES** of a road.
5) Understanding the **CAUSE AND REASONS** behind the accidents, injuries and deaths of people.
6) Analysis of accidents according to the **TYPE OF VEHICLE.**

- Tableau
1) Analysis of accidents based upon the **TIME OF OCCURENCE.**
2) Analysis of accidents as per the **LOCATION of accident.**
